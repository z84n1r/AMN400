AMN400 Consumer Insights for Marketing Success 
Assessment 1: Literature Review 
• 3,000-word (+/- 10%)
• APA referencingAssignment Topic Identify key themes in the consumer research journals about what influences consumer memory that would be of interest to marketers.A key theme is a finding or idea that is discussed in a group of articles.This usually means seeing how ideas have developed over time (e.g., over 10 years). A key theme may relate to a type of message wording or marketing tactic. Alternatively, a theme could relate to how a psychological state of consumers influences how people recall more information. The majority of your assignment should discuss these themes rather than define memory.For the last section of your assignment (approximately 500 to 600 words), discuss the marketing implications of the findings of the research. This shows how the findings from the articles you review could be used by businesses in an industry of your choice. For example, with international airlines, how might they use findings from research to change their promotional campaigns?
